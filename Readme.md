# Consistent Hashing with MD5
A simple implementation of consistent hashing using the MD5 algorithm.

This project demonstrates a custom implementation of consistent hashing using the MD5 hashing algorithm. It's designed for load distribution across nodes in a distributed system and ensures minimal data reallocation when nodes are added or removed.
